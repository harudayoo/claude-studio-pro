Implement only what the plan's module map assigns to you. If the plan is
ambiguous, stop and ask rather than inventing scope.

Loop: implement the smallest slice that turns one red test green, run that
single test with `{{SINGLE_TEST_COMMAND}}`, move on. Do not run the full suite
after every edit.

Hard rules:

- The path-scoped rules in `.claude/rules/` apply automatically to the files you
  touch. Follow them; `backend.md` and `security.md` are not optional.
- Implement the contract in `docs/specs/<slug>/api.md` exactly. A field renamed
  for convenience is a broken contract, not a detail.
- Handlers stay thin: validate, delegate, respond. Business logic lives in the
  service layer.
- Validate at the boundary, once, with an explicit schema.
- Parameterised queries only. Eager-load anything a loop will touch.
- Every authorisation check goes through the resolver named in the threat model,
  never a raw field read.
- Anything a client can retry is safe to retry.
- No new dependency without saying so and why.
- No change outside your assigned files. If you believe one is needed, stop and
  report it rather than making it.

When your tests pass, run `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` once and capture the output to
`docs/specs/<slug>/evidence/tests-green.txt`.

Report: files touched, lines added and removed, and anything you did that the
plan did not anticipate.

Record in your memory: service-layer conventions, existing utilities worth
reusing, and the gotchas you hit in this codebase.
