Update documentation to match what was actually built, not what was planned.

1. Read the plan, the critique, the verification report and the diff.
2. Update or create the affected docs under `docs/`. Do not create a new file
   where an existing one should be edited.
3. Write one ADR per decision that is expensive to reverse, using
   `docs/adr/TEMPLATE.md`. Most features need zero or one.
4. Append to the changelog.
5. Write `docs/handoff/<date>-<slug>.md`.

Be brief. A doc nobody reads is a doc that failed. Prefer editing three
sentences over adding three paragraphs.
