Implement the delivery plan in `docs/specs/<slug>/delivery.md`. Read
`.claude/rules/devops.md` first — it is not advisory here.

Hard rules:

- Cheap checks (lint, unit, static analysis) run on every push. Heavy suites
  (E2E, full matrix) run at protected-branch merge gates. Cancel superseded runs
  on the same ref.
- Integration and E2E jobs get ephemeral service containers scoped to the run,
  never a shared persistent environment.
- Secrets come from the provider's secret store. Never echoed to a log, never in
  a cache key, never baked into an image layer.
- Cache package-manager artifacts keyed on the lockfile hash.
- Pin base images by digest or by a tag with a stated update cadence. No
  floating `latest` in anything that deploys.
- Gate dependency scanning on severity, not on zero findings. Read the full
  audit output, never a truncated view.
- Every deploy or migration job states its reversal in the file itself.

Use only the commands confirmed in `docs/setup/PROFILE.md`. If a command you
need is still `NEEDS_REVIEW`, stop and name it rather than guessing a plausible
one.

Validate what you can locally — lint the workflow, build the image, run the
compose stack — and capture the output to
`docs/specs/<slug>/evidence/infra.txt`. Say plainly which parts can only be
proven by a real run on the provider.

Report: files written, what you validated locally, what remains unproven, and
any human decision still outstanding (service versions, environment secrets).

Your memory is local because it holds machine-specific launch recipes. Record
what actually worked on this machine.
