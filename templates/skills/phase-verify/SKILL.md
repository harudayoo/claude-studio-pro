## Why this is a fan-out, not a step

Security, performance, accessibility, SEO and correctness are genuinely
independent lenses. A single reviewer anchors on the first class of problem it
finds and stops looking. Five narrow reviewers in parallel cost one dispatch and
find five different things.

## Dispatch

Run these **in parallel from a single dispatch**. All are read-only; none may
fix anything in this turn.

| Agent | Lens | Skip when |
|---|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | correctness, contract drift, error handling, duplication | never |
| `security-auditor` | authorisation, IDOR, OWASP, dependencies, secrets | never |
| `qa-runner` | real test execution and browser evidence | no runnable suite |
| `perf-a11y-auditor` | Core Web Vitals, axe, keyboard, breakpoints | no UI change |
| `seo-auditor` | metadata, headings, structured data, crawlability | no public route |

Each returns findings ranked BLOCKER / MAJOR / MINOR, each citing `file:line`
or an advisory ID, plus evidence paths.

## Required output

`docs/specs/<slug>/verification.md` — the merged, deduplicated, severity-ranked
set of findings, plus browser evidence: screenshots at each breakpoint, console
log, network trace.

Merge and rank; do not paste five reports end to end.

## Gate

This phase closes when:

1. Zero BLOCKERs remain.
2. Every MAJOR and MINOR is triaged — fixed, or accepted with a written reason.
3. Evidence exists for each claim. "Done" is a claim; a passing run, a
   screenshot, or an audit file is evidence.
4. **You approve it.**

## Where findings go

Findings that become work re-enter at **TEST**, not at CREATE. A bug fix gets a
failing test first — that is the same rule the whole pipeline is built on, and
the verify gate is exactly where people are most tempted to skip it.

Then update `.claude/state/gate.json`: set `phase` to `document` and append
`verify` to `approved`.
