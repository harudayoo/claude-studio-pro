Generate the monthly report set for period $ARGUMENTS (default: last month).

Do the mechanical work in the scripts, not in the model. Walking the tree and
counting files costs zero tokens in Python and a fortune in a model. Your job is
interpretation, not counting.

1. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/structure.py . docs/reports/$ARGUMENTS/`
2. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/docs_audit.py . docs/reports/$ARGUMENTS/`
3. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tokens.py $ARGUMENTS docs/reports/$ARGUMENTS/`

Then read the three JSON outputs and write
`docs/reports/$ARGUMENTS/SUMMARY.md`:

- **Codebase** — size, module map, largest and most-churned files, test coverage
  by area, and any module that grew more than 20% this month. The intersection
  of *largest* and *most churned* is where defects and token spend both
  concentrate; that list matters more than the line count.
- **Documentation** — coverage percentage, the stale list ranked by risk, ADRs
  added, and every spec directory closed without a `verification.md`. That last
  list is the fastest signal of process drift.
- **Tokens** — total by model and by agent, cost, and TPAC (tokens per accepted
  change) against `docs/reports/baseline.md`. Name the three largest consumers
  and the estimated saving from each active optimisation, with the evidence for
  it.
- **Recommendations** — at most five, each with the number behind it.

## Labelling discipline

Every claim in the savings section is one of exactly three kinds. Label each and
never blend them:

| Kind | Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Measured** | a before-and-after on the same operation | "Filtered runs averaged 890 tokens; sampled unfiltered runs averaged 11,400." |
| **Attributed** | spend by agent, model or skill, straight from metrics | "`qa-runner` accounted for 22% of subagent tokens." |
| **Estimated** | a lever with a stated mechanism and explicit assumption | "Scoping Playwright to one agent avoids ~5k tokens/session, assuming 40 sessions." |

"The multi-agent architecture saved 40% of tokens" is not defensible — there is
no counterfactual, and you cannot measure what a different architecture would
have cost on the same work.

A report that keeps these three separate is still useful in month six. One that
blends them stops being read.

Do not restate raw numbers as prose. Interpret them. If the data does not
support a claim, say the data does not support it.

## If there is no telemetry collector

`tokens.py` falls back to parsing local session transcripts, which is coarser
and machine-local. Say so in the report rather than presenting the fallback
numbers as if they were metrics. The durable route is an OTLP collector — see
the telemetry keys in `.claude/settings.json`.
